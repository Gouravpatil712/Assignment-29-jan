However, it is recommended to keep the length of an identifier to a reasonable limit for readability and maintainability purposes. The Python style guide (PEP 8) suggests that the maximum length of an identifier should be around 79 characters."

    "Answer - Easy to learn and use Python has a simple and straightforward syntax, making it an ideal language for beginners.  Python is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Large community, Python has a huge user community, which means you'll find a lot of resources for learning, solving problems, and getting help.  Python has a large number of libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and more, that can be used to perform various tasks. In Python, you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you create it. This makes it easier to write flexible code that can handle different data types. Python can be integrated with other programming languages, such as C and Java, and can also be used to control other applications, such as Microsoft Office.\n",

    "Question 14 - How is memory managed in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager through reference counting and garbage collection. The memory manager keeps track of the number of references to objects in memory and frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer being used. This results in a convenient, high-level, and dynamic memory management system that requires minimal effort from the programmer."
